                <p>We are Mrs. K and the Tortoise Café, where you can enjoy your time with tortoises with a cup of coffee. They don't shed fur, they don't have claws, and they don't have a weird superiority complex. They are cute and easily attracted by simple snacks. Here you don't need to have a lot of interaction skills with animals to easily experience the fun of being with turtles. It is suitable for allergy-prone people and pet lovers from all walks of life. Please feel free to ask us for a reservation, already prepared with your favorite turtles, favorite drinks and snacks you want to feed, come and have fun with your turtle friends!</p>
                <p>In our coffee shop project, we set up five employees, each with a profile of four customers. If you need to check the booking details of a customer, you can select the name of the employee you want to see on the home page, click the submit button and you will be taken to the page of the selected employee. Then click on the corresponding customer number in the employee page to go to the customer page and get the specific customer booking details. The customer page contains Customer Number, Name, Favourite Coffee, Turtle Turtle Snack, Customer Address, Customer Email and Customer Phone. If you have selected the wrong employee and want to return to the home page, you can click on Back to Reservation System at the top of the employee page.</p>
